I have been a fan of [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/)'s work. It's been inspiring to see how simulation can bring complex system to live, to deepen the understanding of those systems in an interactive way, and all coded with modern web technologies that make them easily accessible.

To help distribute some of the great work from Nicky, I translated two projects into Chinese. One is about the local to global mechanisms on how fireflies can shine synchrounously all at once even if there are disturbances. Another is about the science of memory and skills to remeber things longer and more profoundly.
