I have been a fan of [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/)'s work. It's been inspiring to see how simulations can bring complex systems to life, deepen the understanding of those systems in an interactive way, and all coded with modern web technologies that make them easily accessible.

To help distribute some of the great work from Nicky, I translated two projects into Chinese. One is about the local-to-global mechanisms of how fireflies can shine synchronously all at once with arbitrary disturbances. The other is about the science of memory and techniques to remember things longer and more profoundly.

Check them out if you are a Chinese speaker:
